Meanbee Visual Stock Levels Extension
=====================

When your customers view your configurable product pages, the default "In Stock" label can be misleading. This label will still inform your customers that you have products in stock when in reality one or more of the associated products may be out of stock or low.

Meanbee Visual Stock Levels provides a flexible, and informative method of giving customers a clearer picture of your stock levels without revealing your business’ internal information.

Our module seamlessly integrates with Magento's administration area and your default attribute set which allows your store to install and configure this feature with ease.

All you need to do is:

- Install the module
- Modify the module’s configuration
- That’s it! Your configurable products will now display Meanbee’s Visual Stock Levels

Another thing we should probably mention is that we're professional Magento Developers. We've built this module to the highest standards following best practices in Magento module development.
